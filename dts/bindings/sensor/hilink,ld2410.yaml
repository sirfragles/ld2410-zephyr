  HiLink LD2410 24GHz FMCW mmWave human presence sensor.
  Supports LD2410, LD2410B, and LD2410C variants.

  The sensor communicates over UART and must be declared as a
  child node of a UART peripheral node.

compatible: "hilink,ld2410"

include:
  - uart-device.yaml

properties:
  out-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Optional GPIO connected to the sensor OUT pin for hardware
      presence detection. When specified, the driver automatically
      configures this GPIO as an input during initialization.

examples:
  - |
    &uart1 {
            current-speed = <256000>;
            ld2410: ld2410 {
                    compatible = "hilink,ld2410";
                    out-gpios = <&gpio0 26 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
            };
    };
